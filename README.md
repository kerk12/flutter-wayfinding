Forked from [@situm/flutter-wayfinding](https://github.com/situmtech/flutter-wayfinding) to add a call to fetch device IDs. 

This repo is used in the [PALAEMON Passenger App](https://github.com/kerk12/palaemon_passenger_app) to provide integration with Situm.

Big thanks to the creators of the original repo. It works amazingly! Of course, **all credit goes to them**. I've only added the device ID callback.
